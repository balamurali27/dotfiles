c uses call by value (Unlike python!)
	so use one time variables carefully
Use -g compile flag to use gdb
To get input from file rather than STDIN when using gdb
	`gdb a.out`
	`start < input.in`
step multiple times in gdb using
	`step 25` (to step 25 times)
sizeof(ptr) will always return 8 or some other value depending on memory of pointers
	therefore sizeof(pointer to string) won't be same strlen
